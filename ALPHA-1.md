# Current version

- The resolution action checks the validity of all the participations, considering them into two states; submited and resolved.
- The winner candidate has the highest score based on a contractual rule, not on economic incentives of the creator.
- The creator has economic incentives to add all the participations, in order to avoid the omitted participation penalties.
- Omission action doesn't control if the participation was created directly with the participation_resolved.es script; that means that the resolve_counter is not fully specific.
- Doesn't support hight volume of participants and don't control it.
- Judges are not incentivized.
